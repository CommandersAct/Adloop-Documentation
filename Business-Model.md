# Business Model

> Can you explain your business model?

Adloop is a subscription-based SaaS application. We offer 3 subscription packages: Start for advertisers with relatively small budgets, Scale for medium to large advertisers and Enterprise for advertisers of all sizes wishing to implement digital media optimization tactics.

> What is your pricing based on? What happens if my spend varies from month to month?

Pricing is based on your monthly media spend. When you subscribe, you choose a package based on the maximum monthly amount you expect to spend, and this determines the price level of the Adloop subscription.

If your spending increases over the course of the year and exceeds the chosen spending threshold, you will be asked to readjust the package.

&#x20;

> What kind of consulting services do you provide? Is there a charge?

A team of Customer Success Managers is at your disposal to help you discover the solution.

Technical support is always free of charge. By technical support we mean any malfunctions or bugs you may encounter when using the solution.

Personalized consulting is subject to a fixed hourly fee that you can subscribe to. Depending on the package you choose, a part of the service is included in the fixed price you pay.
