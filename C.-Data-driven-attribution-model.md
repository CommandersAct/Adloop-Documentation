# C. Data-driven attribution model
> In addition to our data-driven attribution models, we also offer
**classical ones**: first click, last click, linear etc.

Adloop data-driven attribution model is based on users\' behaviour. We
use all the micro-conversions available in your Analytics source, like
key pageviews (product or category), click on a CTA, add to basket and
so on.

The **more micro-conversions** you are tracking, the **more detailled
our data-driven model** will be! So don't hesitate to track new actions
on your website.

Then, for each micro-conversion, you have to indicate to Adloop **how
engaging this action** is on the path to conversion. For that, we use
commitment levels, from very low to very high.

By default we scale:

-   the *pageview* as very low commitment, as viewing a page is the most
    basic action you can do on a website

-   the *new users* as very high commitment, as it gives value to the
    upper-funnel channels bringing in new users

Some examples of scaling that could help you when setting up the
data-driven attribution model:

-   *view of a product page*: low commitment

-   *view of a category page*: low commitment

-   *displaying the details of a product*: medium commitment

-   *add to wishlist*: high commitment

-   *add to basket*: very high commitment

-   *subscribe to newsletter*: very high commitment

-   *store locator*: medium commitment

-   *demo booking*: very high commitment

Those are just few examples, as every website is different, you are the
best to judge how engaging the actions on your website are.

> If you don't know which micro-conversions to use, just navigate on your
website and put yourself in the shoes of a potential customer
discovering your website for the first time and then purchasing!

We scale differently the different steps of the conversion funnel:
delivery choice, delivery address, contact information, payment choice.
Those are not to be included in the commitment scaling step.

Our algorithm will take into account the scaling of the
micro-conversions when calculating attribution.

**The more a user interacts with the website on a touchpoint, the more
credit this touchpoint will get when calculating the attribution and
contribution.** This touchpoint will get a bigger fraction of the
conversion and of the revenue.
