# Reporting

> What's the difference between dashboards and reports?

A dashboard is a set of graphs or tables displaying data graphically and
synthetically. They are generally used to present information in a
visual and synthetic way.

Reports provide access to a much greater level of detail (down to the
keyword or creative level). There are two standard types of report:
tables and graphs, and three types dedicated to attribution (Transaction
ID, Path Explorer and Channel Affinity).

 

> What types of graphs are included in the dashboards?

We offer Line/Bar/Area graphs and pie charts.

 

> How long does it take to load dashboards or reports?

Loading time is variable and depends on the amount of data in your
reports. Generally, it takes just a few seconds to display your data,
but for complex dashboards, it can take 15 or 20 seconds.

However, as the data is stored in a database integrated into your Adloop
workspace, data access time is as fast as possible, and you\'ll never
experience loading errors or incomplete data as you may encounter with
applications that don't store data, such as Looker Studio or even Excel
by a source aggregator like Supermetrics...

 

> Can I share dashboards with people who don't have access to Adloop?

Yes, any Adloop report can be shared externally via a unique
(perma-)link, and is password-protected for added security given the
sensitivity of the data.

Recipients of dashboards and reports shared in this way cannot modify
the reports: they can neither add data nor change the period viewed.

 

> Can I open or remove accesses myself?

Yes, of course, if you are the administrator of the space, you can open
accesses to other users and manage existing accesses directly from the
interface.

 

> Is it possible to limit access to a single channel?

No, this is not currently possible. You can, however, share a report in
filtered public mode on a specific channel, or set up filtered exports.

 

> Can I compare attribution models in reports?

Yes, each assigned metric is linked to a template and available in the
metric selector. You can select as many attributed metrics as you like
in a report to compare them with each other.

For example, you can compare the number of Conversions of the Last Click
model vs. the Data Driven model of Adloop.
Or even display at the same time for your Search campaigns: the Revenue
reported by Google Ads, the one indicated by Google Analytics and the
one calculated by Adloop\'s Data-driven model.

 

> Can I compare several periods in my reports?

It is possible to compare periods in several of our reports: table and
dashboard. However, the graphical and attribution reports can only
display a single period.\
To activate period comparison in a report, simply activate the
comparison in the date selector.

 

> Do you standardize metrics and dimensions?

Yes, we do. We aggregate identical source metrics and dimensions under
common metrics and dimensions.
For example, under our normalized "Ad Spend" metric, we aggregate all
the "Ad Spend" metrics from the various data sources that report this
metric (Google Search Ad Spend, Meta Ad Spend, Google Shopping Ad Spend
etc.).
Similarly, we aggregate "Google Search keyword" and "Bing Search
keyword" values under the standardized "SEA keyword" dimension.

 

> Can I create my own metrics?

Yes, custom metrics are available in Adloop in two ways:
Either it's a metric created in your advertising platform (such as
Google Ads, Meta Ads or Google Analytics), in which case you'll be able
to select it in the API connector of the application in question.
Or you want to create your own metrics from those already available, and
you can use our 'calculated metrics' system to create new metrics
according to your needs.

 

> Can I see my different conversions (leads, subscriptions, etc.) in the
> reports?

Yes, as soon as a conversion is tracked in one of your advertising or
analytics platforms, it can be imported into Adloop.
