Adloop reporting tool is very powerful: you can combine any data type from multiples Sources, filter them, order them etc. 

All reports use at least one of the following four elements: 


* dimensions 


* metrics


* period


* “go” button

## Step 1: Choose Dimensions 
You can, using the  **Dimensions Pickers** , choose the  **Dimensions**  from  **Data Sources**  you added. 

Dimensions can be used either as the base of your report or as filters.
